IDK, I'd probably just license this with the same license as the original YouAreAnIdiot, but... that has no license from what I know.

This project was made for fun and not meant to infringe upon the rights of YouAreAnIdiot's original JS's creator(s). The code port was by me (Dominic Hayes - The Feren OS Dev), but the original code it has been ported from is by the original YouAreAnIdiot's creator(s).
Everything but the Python script is outsourced from the YouAreAnIdiot archive on Web Archive, and some other archives, and thus belongs to their respective owners.
